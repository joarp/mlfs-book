-- C-level --
* Add 3 day lagged pm25 measurments
* Add something else that improve performance
* Keep the baseline model running
* Train the updated model aswell

Compare baseline and new model after training and the difference in upcoming predictions.


-- A-level --
Use: city as KEY, URL/API as VALUE

* Create info.csv containing URL values for each city key

nb1:
* add pm25 data from all cities into same feature group, will use city as key later (including lagged data)
* add weather data for each city into same feature group
* Use only city and URL API for each station

nb2:
* Same principle as nb1

nb3:
* Train a separate model for each city, identified by the city.

nb4:
* Use each model for inference
* Store nice graphics
    * Same prediction graph as before
    * Comparison of prediction
    * Comparison of error/accuracy

Also:
* Add separate solutions for the stations with few observations
* Keep baseline for one station
